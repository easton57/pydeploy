# PyDeploy

Python Based patch and software deployment system that's free for anyone to use. Even in an enterprise capacity.

Functionality is very basic at this time. CLI, hard coded parameters for specific executables. May add database support  
to save parameters for executables as well as enable drag and drop onto the GUI window to place the installer in the  
patches folder. Only time will tell.
